# Demo `tools.go`

Repo demonstrates how to use `tools.go` for managing Go CLI tools on repo/project level.

Key artifacts to check:

- `Makefile`
- `tools/` folder
- `.bin/` folder (generate by `make`)
- `pkg/magic/magic.go` - see `go:generate` comment

Please check my blog post [Manage Go CLI tools via Go modules and tools.go](https://github.com/halyph/mind-flow/blob/master/docs/blog/2023/2023-11-27-tools-go.md) that contains much more details.
